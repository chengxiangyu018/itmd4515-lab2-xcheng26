Xiangyu Cheng Lab 2 README

1.I select the sakila database,and use the actor table to be a java POJO.I select all of the field that in actor table such as actor_id,
first_name,last_name,last_update to java class.

2.I select the test scop,because it is only get been available for testing phase of maven and it's not gonna be packaged with my application.

3.Maven is a project resource management tool that only manages resources and does not participate in the operation of projects.
Without maven,if we run a project ,first we should to download all of the jar packages that been used and if one package depends on another package,we
also should download other package.Then when dependency conflicts occur, we need to troubleshoot them one by one.
Maven help us to manage the dependences of the jar packages,reduce redundancy of packages and unify development specifications and tools;
